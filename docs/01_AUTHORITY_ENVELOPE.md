# Authority Envelope

An Authority Envelope defines the maximum permitted capability of an AI system.

Every envelope must explicitly declare:

- Allowed domains of sight
- Forbidden domains (shadow zones)
- Permitted actions (if any)
- Human escalation boundaries
- Audit requirements

No system may exceed its envelope, even if capability exists.
