# AEGIS Charter

AEGIS (Authority Envelope Governance Interface Specification) exists to
define how AI systems operate safely under bounded authority.

Core Principles:
- AI elevates human judgment — it does not replace it.
- Observation is never action.
- Evidence is not authority.
- Unknowns are risks, not gaps to be filled.
- Shadow zones are intentional blind spots, not failures.

AEGIS is not a product.
It is a governance protocol.
