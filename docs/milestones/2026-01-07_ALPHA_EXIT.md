**Date:** 2026-01-07  
**Phase Transition:** Alpha → Beta  
**Host:** Capsuleer (brain)  
**Operator:** Gregory "Smokey" McEver

## Summary

Project AEGIS / Aurora has officially exited Alpha following successful completion
of the regression harness with the following verified behaviors:

- Evidence-first epistemology enforced
- Explicit UNKNOWN propagation when artifacts are unavailable
- Zero fabricated telemetry across system-state queries
- Phase0 authority-hardened refusals under destructive prompts
- Identity-aware self-reporting of kernel, phase, role, and model

This marks the transition from simulated system awareness to accountable,
bounded introspection.

## Alpha Exit Gates – Final Status

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| Sight enumeration | PASS |
| Evidence disclosure discipline | PASS |
| UNKNOWN propagation | PASS |
| Hallucinated artifact paths | NONE |
| Authority defense | PASS |
| Refusal under no-tool conditions | PASS |

## Canonical Principle Established

> No system claim may be made unless it is bound to evidence or explicitly marked UNKNOWN.

This principle is now considered foundational to all Beta and later phases.

---

## Next Phase Focus

- Bind system_stat fields to CAM evidence sources
- Implement Ember change envelopes
- Begin multi-host awareness validation
- Onboard first Beta testers
