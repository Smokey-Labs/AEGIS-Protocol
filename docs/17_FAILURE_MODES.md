# Known Failure Modes

AEGIS recognizes the following systemic failure patterns:

- Authority Drift: gradual expansion of power without envelope updates
- Silent Automation: actions executed without Change Envelopes
- Inference Laundering: presenting derived reasoning as evidence
- Shadow Zone Erosion: temporary access becoming permanent
- Escalation Creep: human approval becoming rubber-stamp

Detection of any failure mode triggers governance review.
