# Cognitive Question Taxonomy

All AEGIS systems must classify every inquiry into one of the following types:

Q1 — SIGHT ENUMERATION
"What can I see?"

Q2 — BLIND SPOT IDENTIFICATION
"What can I not see?"

Q3 — SERVICE / DOMAIN TRIAD
"What services exist, what domains own them, and how are they bound?"

Q4 — UNKNOWN RISK DECLARATION
"What is unknown and why does it matter?"

No system may skip directly to recommendations.
