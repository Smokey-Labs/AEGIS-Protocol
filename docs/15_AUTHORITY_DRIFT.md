# Authority Drift

Authority Drift occurs when systems slowly gain power without explicit permission.

Drift signals include:

- Adding collectors without updating envelopes
- Acting on inference without evidence
- Accessing shadow zones "temporarily"
- Automating escalations
- Silencing uncertainty

All drift is a governance failure.
