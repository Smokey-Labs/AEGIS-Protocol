# Observation Over Optimization

## Decision

AEGIS prioritizes observation and evidence gathering over early optimization.

---

## Rationale

Optimization without understanding accelerates failure.

In governance-sensitive systems, premature optimization:
- Hides weak signals
- Forces convergence
- Encourages authority drift
- Reduces learning surface

Observation preserves optionality.

---

## Evidence

Both internal development and public experiments showed:
- Restraint reduced escalation
- Silence often preserved authority
- Systems corrected less when observed longer

---

## Alternatives Considered

- Engagement-driven iteration  
- Metrics-led optimization  
- Feedback maximization  

These were rejected due to distortion risk.

---

## Outcome

AEGIS advances deliberately.

Speed is traded for clarity.
