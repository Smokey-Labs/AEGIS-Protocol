# Authority Scoping
**AEGIS Canonical Governance Mechanism**

## Purpose

Authority Scoping exists to prevent **unexamined authority transfer**.

Before any idea, process, document, workflow, or capability is adopted, standardized, or legitimized within AEGIS, its impact on **decision authority** must be explicitly examined.

Authority Scoping provides a formal, legitimate pause point where thinking is allowed to remain unresolved without losing credibility.

---

## Definition

**Authority Scoping** is the deliberate evaluation of an item to determine:

- What authority it concentrates
- What authority it displaces
- What decisions it makes easier to skip
- What defaults it introduces
- Whether these effects are justified, bounded, and legible

Authority Scoping is **evaluative, not prescriptive**.  
It does not imply acceptance, rejection, or implementation.

Its sole purpose is **clarity of authority movement**.

---

## What Requires Authority Scoping

Authority Scoping is required for **anything that can influence human decision-making**, including but not limited to:

- System features or capabilities
- Automation proposals
- Workflows and processes
- Templates and standardized documents
- Governance mechanisms
- Evaluation criteria
- “Helpful” abstractions
- Research directions
- Novel or “cool” ideas
- Internal process changes

If something affects *how*, *when*, or *whether* humans decide, it qualifies.

---

## What Authority Scoping Is Not

Authority Scoping is **not**:

- A design review
- A prioritization exercise
- A feature gate
- A commitment to build
- A quality assessment
- A demand for completeness

Authority Scoping may legitimately conclude with:
- Rejection
- Deferral
- Non-standardization
- Permanent exclusion

Refusal is a valid and respected outcome.

---

## Authority Scoping vs Other AEGIS Concepts

These distinctions are intentional:

- **Doctrine** defines authority boundaries that must never be crossed
- **Theory** explains why authority drifts under pressure
- **Authority Scoping** asks whether authority should move at all
- **Governance** enforces authority once granted
- **Decisions** record how authority was exercised
- **Issues / Tasks** track work, not legitimacy

Authority Scoping always precedes governance and implementation.

---

## Canonical Authority Scoping Questions

An authority-scoped item should be examined using questions such as:

- What decision authority does this centralize?
- What human judgment does this reduce or bypass?
- What assumptions does this make about user discipline?
- What happens under fatigue, urgency, or excitement?
- What refusal becomes socially or procedurally harder?
- What silence becomes implicit consent?
- What happens if this becomes “normal”?

Incomplete answers are acceptable.  
Unasked questions are not.

---

## Canonical Outcomes

Every Authority Scoping exercise must land in one of the following states:

- **Rejected**  
  Authority impact is unjustifiable or unsafe.

- **Constrained**  
  Allowed only under explicit, bounded conditions.

- **Deferred**  
  Insufficient evidence or maturity; revisit later.

- **Accepted**  
  Authority shift is explicit, bounded, and supported.

Implicit acceptance is not allowed.

---

## Relationship to Social Engineering

Authority Scoping explicitly treats **excitement, novelty, urgency, and confidence** as risk signals.

Any idea that gains momentum by:
- compressing deliberation time
- borrowing authority
- discouraging refusal
- framing delay as failure

must be treated as hostile until scoped.

Social engineering represents authority drift applied intentionally.  
Authority Scoping exists to surface the same mechanisms when they appear internally.

---

## Authority Scoping as a Cultural Rule

Within AEGIS:

> **Anything worth doing is worth Authority Scoping.  
> Anything not worth Authority Scoping is not worth doing.**

This applies equally to:
- technical systems
- documentation
- workflows
- governance changes
- internal practices

---

## Closing Statement

Authority does not disappear.  
It relocates — often quietly, often unintentionally.

Authority Scoping ensures that no relocation occurs without being:
- visible
- questioned
- bounded
- and consciously accepted

AEGIS does not fear progress.  
It refuses **unexamined progress**.
