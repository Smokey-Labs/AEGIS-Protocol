# Foresight Review Framework

This document defines how AEGIS identifies emerging risk before authority boundaries are violated.

Foresight exists to prevent escalation, not to justify it.

---

## When This Review Is Required

A foresight review must be performed when:

- New evidence sources are introduced
- Authority scope is expanded
- Automation capability increases
- Incident Feedback Loop triggers
- Drift Response Framework is invoked

---

## Foresight Questions

Each review must answer:

- What new risks exist today that did not exist yesterday?
- Which authority boundaries are being stressed?
- Which failure modes are becoming more likely?
- What guardrails must be strengthened before action is taken?

## Risk Prediction Outputs

| Artifact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Emerging Risk Register | New or escalating risks |
| Envelope Pressure Map | Which boundaries are under strain |
| Guardrail Proposal | New preventative controls |
| Review Timestamp | Date of last foresight pass |

## Enforcement Rule

No authority expansion may occur without a completed foresight review.
