## How to Read the AEGIS Case Studies

The AEGIS case studies are not success stories, tutorials, or proofs of correctness.  
They are **bounded observational analyses** intended to surface governance-relevant behavior under real collaboration.

Reading them correctly matters.

### What These Case Studies Are

Each case study is:
- A **descriptive account**, not a prescription
- Grounded in **observable behavior and artifacts**
- Explicit about **limits, assumptions, and scope**
- Written to withstand **skeptical, technical review**

They document *what happened*, not *what should always happen*.

---

### What These Case Studies Are Not

They are **not**:
- Marketing material
- Claims of AI self-awareness
- Evidence of model training or configuration changes
- Generalizable guarantees
- Instructions for how to “use” an AI

If you are looking for:
- A repeatable method
- A step-by-step framework
- A success recipe

These documents will intentionally disappoint you.

---

### Authority and Perspective

Each case study declares its **point of view** up front.

Examples:
- *AI Perspective*:  
  Describes how interaction patterns shaped responses, without claiming internal state or intent.
- *Third-Person Human Analysis*:  
  Describes observable human behavior as seen through transcripts and artifacts, not inferred psychology.

Perspective defines **what can be claimed** and **what cannot**.

### Evidence vs Interpretation

Where evidence is direct:
- It is described concretely
- It is traceable to artifacts (transcripts, documents, issue history)

Where interpretation is required:
- It is explicitly labeled
- Assumptions are surfaced
- Confidence levels are bounded

Readers are encouraged to **disagree with interpretations** while respecting the evidence presented.

---

### Why These Case Studies Exist

AEGIS argues that:
- Governance failures often originate in human behavior
- Tooling alone cannot prevent authority drift
- Accountability must be owned, not delegated

The case studies exist to examine whether those claims hold up **in practice**, not in theory.

They are inputs to reasoning, not conclusions.

---

### How to Engage Critically

When reading, ask:
- What behavior is being described?
- What evidence supports it?
- What assumptions are acknowledged?
- Where could this fail in a different context?

If a case study prompts disagreement, that is not a failure of the document —  
it is evidence that it is doing its job.

---

### Final Note

AEGIS treats documentation as a **constraint**, not a persuasion tool.

These case studies are meant to:
- Reduce ambiguity
- Surface tradeoffs
- Preserve accountability
- Invite scrutiny

Read them with the same discipline they were written with.
