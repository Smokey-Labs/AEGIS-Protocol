# ADR-0001: AEGIS Is a Governance Protocol

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-06

---

## Context

Most intelligent systems are built tool-first. Governance is retrofitted after harm, drift, or failure.

---

## Decision

AEGIS will be defined first and foremost as a **governance protocol**, not a software product.

---

## Consequences

- All implementations must conform to protocol rules.
- No feature may bypass the Authority Envelope.
- Drift prevention is a design requirement, not a future enhancement.
