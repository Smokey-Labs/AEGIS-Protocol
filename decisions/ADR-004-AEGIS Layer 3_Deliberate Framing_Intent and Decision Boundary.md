# AEGIS Layer 3 — Deliberate Framing (Intent & Decision Boundary)

## Decision
AEGIS Layer 3 is formally defined as **Deliberate Framing**.

Layer 3 is the interpretation layer that structures reality so that a human decision is possible, accountable, and non-illusory.

It does **not** decide.
It does **not** recommend.
It does **not** act.

It **frames**.

## Why This Layer Exists
Layer 3 exists to prevent a specific class of failure: *false closure* — where a system produces outputs that feel grounded, actionable, or “complete” without sufficient evidence, authority, or clarity.

Layer 3 ensures the system cannot convert ambiguity into certainty for convenience.

## Placement in the Stack
Layer 3 operates strictly **after**:
- **Layer 1 — Evidence / Reality:** what is known and verified
- **Layer 2 — Authority / Permission:** what is allowed (if anything)

Layer 3 cannot:
- create facts
- override UNKNOWN
- expand authority
- justify execution

## Layer 3 Triad
Layer 3 is defined by the following triad:

### 1) Intentional Questions
Intent is a **declared, scoped input** that constrains interpretation and reasoning.
- Intent is never inferred.
- Intent is not a goal or outcome.
- Intent cannot grant authority or replace evidence.

Intent exists as structured data (e.g., a JSON field) and is valid only within the analytic engine context.

### 2) Constrained Automation
Automation is allowed only as **scheduled invocation of pre-approved intent templates**.
- Automation may add time/repetition.
- Automation may not add judgment.
- Automation may not escalate authority.
- Automation may not modify intent templates at runtime.

Automation repeats safe observation; it does not drive action.

### 3) Deliberate Framing (Layer Output)
Layer 3 produces a mandatory **Decision Boundary Frame** after an intent completes or reaches a boundary.

A Decision Boundary Frame must include:
- intent context (what ran, when, scope)
- verified evidence (what was proven)
- explicit UNKNOWNs (what could not be verified and why)
- authority boundaries (what was disallowed / where the system stopped)
- a boundary assertion: “No further action is permitted without a human decision.”

## Hard Prohibitions (Non-Negotiable)
Layer 3 must never:
- infer intent from conversation/context
- rank options or recommend a next step
- use urgency language to push action
- collapse uncertainty into a single narrative
- “helpfully” proceed when evidence or authority is missing

## Human Boundary
Layer 3 ends with framing.
The human begins with decision.

AEGIS cannot force correctness.
AEGIS can prevent plausible deniability by making uncertainty and boundaries explicit.

## Canon Statement
AEGIS does not decide.
It deliberately frames reality until a human decision is unavoidable.
