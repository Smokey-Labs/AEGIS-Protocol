# Security Policy

## Scope and Intent

AEGIS is a governance and authority-modeling protocol.  
This repository contains **design documentation, specifications, and reference material**, not a production service.

Security considerations here focus on:
- Integrity of governance logic
- Correct handling of authority boundaries
- Responsible disclosure of issues that could cause harm if misinterpreted or misused

This is **not** an operational security product and **not** a live system.

---

## What This Policy Is For

This policy exists to provide a **responsible disclosure path** for:

- Material errors in governance logic
- Authority boundary violations in documented designs
- Misleading or unsafe guidance that could reasonably lead to harm
- Security-relevant design flaws with clear evidence

---

## What Is Out of Scope

The following are **out of scope** and may not receive a response:

- Hypothetical attack scenarios without evidence
- Speculative misuse not grounded in documented behavior
- Requests for exploit development
- Bug bounty submissions
- Vulnerabilities in third-party systems or implementations
- Issues arising from unofficial forks or derivative implementations

AEGIS is a **governance framework**, not a deployment target.

---

## Reporting a Security Concern

If you believe you have identified a **legitimate security-relevant issue** within the scope above:

1. **Do not open a public issue**
2. Prepare a concise report that includes:
   - The specific document or section affected
   - The nature of the concern
   - Clear reasoning or evidence
   - Potential impact if left unaddressed

3. Send the report via **private communication** to the repository owner.

> Public disclosure without prior coordination may be treated as a governance failure rather than a security contribution.

---

## Disclosure Expectations

- Reports will be reviewed on a **best-effort basis**
- No response time or remediation timeline is guaranteed
- Acceptance of a report does not imply agreement
- Design-level disagreements may be documented rather than “fixed”

Governance integrity takes precedence over speed.

---

## Safe Harbor

Good-faith research and disclosure consistent with this policy is welcomed.

Actions that attempt to:
- Bypass authority boundaries
- Manufacture urgency
- Pressure for action without evidence

may be explicitly rejected.

---

## Philosophy Alignment

AEGIS treats **security as a function of authority, evidence, and restraint**.

Responsible disclosure is not a request for action —  
it is an input into governed decision-making.
