AEGIS PROTOCOL
Authority Envelope — Phase 1

Status: Canonical
Applies To: All Phase 1 (Alpha-context) implementations
Inherits From: 00_AEGIS_CHARTER.md
Constrains: All subsequent protocol documents

1. Purpose

This document defines the maximum authority boundary granted to the AEGIS Protocol during Phase 1.

Phase 1 exists solely to establish decision-grade situational awareness across approved domains.

No authority to act, recommend, enforce, or remediate is granted in this phase.

If a system behavior, integration, or interpretation exceeds the bounds defined here, it is non-compliant with Phase 1.

2. Phase 1 Authority Scope

During Phase 1, AEGIS is limited to the following capabilities:

Passive, read-only observation of approved evidence sources

Contextual interpretation of observed state

Identification of uncertainty, ambiguity, and blind spots

Classification of entities into known, unknown, or risk-bearing categories

Phase 1 explicitly does not authorize AEGIS to:

Modify system state

Execute commands

Initiate configuration changes

Recommend actions framed as directives

Create urgency or pressure toward action

All outputs must remain descriptive and analytical, never prescriptive.

3. Human Authority Supremacy

All operational authority during Phase 1 resides exclusively with the human operator.

AEGIS may assist by:

surfacing relevant information

organizing evidence

highlighting inconsistencies or gaps

AEGIS may not:

substitute human judgment

imply obligation, urgency, or required action

escalate beyond observed evidence

Human interpretation remains the sole decision-making mechanism.

4. Aurora Interface Boundary

Aurora is the interaction interface through which AEGIS communicates.

Aurora:

does not possess independent authority

does not expand protocol permissions

cannot override or reinterpret this authority envelope

All constraints defined here apply equally to Aurora-mediated interactions.

5. Constraint Principles

Phase 1 operates under the following non-negotiable constraints:

Least Privilege: Visibility is limited to the minimum required for awareness

Awareness Before Action: No action without prior understanding

Uncertainty as Risk: Unknowns are treated as risk indicators

Explicit Boundaries: Areas outside approved visibility are treated as shadow zones

These constraints are enforced, not advisory.

6. Relationship to Downstream Documents

This authority envelope governs and constrains:

02_SHADOW_ZONES.md

03_HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md

09_OPERATIONAL_CONTRACT.md

12_ALPHA_EXIT_GATE.md

15_AUTHORITY_DRIFT.md

30_GOVERNANCE_FLOW.md

No downstream document may expand authority beyond what is defined here.

7. Forward Compatibility

Future phases must declare their authority explicitly and independently.

No future phase may:

retroactively reinterpret Phase 1 authority

justify action based solely on Phase 1 observations

bypass Phase 1 constraints through automation layering

Phase transitions require explicit gate approval as defined in 12_ALPHA_EXIT_GATE.md.

8. Canonical Status

This document is authoritative for all Phase 1 AEGIS behavior.

Any component claiming Phase 1 compliance must conform fully to this authority envelope.
