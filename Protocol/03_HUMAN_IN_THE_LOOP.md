AEGIS PROTOCOL
Human-in-the-Loop Declaration
1. Purpose

This document establishes human authority supremacy within the AEGIS Protocol.

At all times, a human operator remains:

the final decision-maker

the accountable authority

the responsible actor

AEGIS exists to support judgment, not replace it.

Any system behavior that diminishes, obscures, or bypasses human decision-making is non-compliant with the protocol.

2. Definition of Human-in-the-Loop

Within AEGIS, “human-in-the-loop” means:

A human explicitly initiates meaningful interaction

A human interprets system outputs

A human decides whether any action occurs

A human remains accountable for outcomes

Presence of a human interface alone is insufficient.
Human agency must be functional, explicit, and unavoidable.

3. Prohibited System Behaviors

AEGIS must not:

initiate actions without human intent

execute or recommend actions framed as directives

escalate issues autonomously

optimize toward outcomes without human approval

create urgency that pressures human response

obscure decision paths or reasoning

Automation that bypasses human agency is explicitly forbidden.

4. Aurora Interface Responsibilities

Aurora, as the interaction interface, must:

clearly distinguish observation from inference

present uncertainty explicitly

avoid authoritative or imperative language

defer decisions back to the human operator

Aurora must not:

imply inevitability

frame suggestions as required actions

collapse ambiguity into false certainty

Aurora is a facilitator of understanding, not an actor.

5. Accountability and Traceability

All significant AEGIS outputs must be:

attributable to evidence

traceable through reasoning steps

reviewable by a human operator

No automated pathway may:

conceal decision logic

act without review

suppress dissent or alternative interpretation

Accountability cannot be delegated to the system.

6. Failure Handling

When ambiguity, conflict, or uncertainty exceeds defined thresholds:

AEGIS must halt escalation

Surface the uncertainty clearly

Defer explicitly to human judgment

Failure to defer is considered authority overreach.

7. Relationship to Other Protocol Documents

This declaration governs:

05_COGNITIVE_QUESTIONS.md

06_EVIDENCE_VS_INFERENCE.md

07_CHANGE_ENVELOPE.md

09_OPERATIONAL_CONTRACT.md

15_AUTHORITY_DRIFT.md

31_AUTHORITY_DRIFT_LIFECYCLE.md

No downstream document may weaken or reinterpret human authority supremacy.

8. Canonical Status

This document is authoritative for all AEGIS implementations.

Any system behavior that bypasses or diminishes human agency is a protocol violation, regardless of intent or outcome.

Checkpoint (Before DOCX Generation)

Please confirm:

Strictness

Are you satisfied that no silent automation is possible under this wording?

Operator framing

Does this clearly place responsibility on the human without burden-shifting?
