# AEGIS Protocol  
## Human-in-the-Loop Declaration

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes **human authority supremacy** within the AEGIS Protocol.

At all times, a human operator remains:

- The final decision-maker  
- The accountable authority  
- The responsible actor  

AEGIS exists to **support judgment, not replace it**.

Any system behavior that diminishes, obscures, or bypasses human decision-making is **non-compliant with the protocol**.

---

## 2. Definition of Human-in-the-Loop

Within AEGIS, *human-in-the-loop* means:

- A human explicitly initiates meaningful interaction  
- A human interprets system outputs  
- A human decides whether any action occurs  
- A human remains accountable for outcomes  

Presence of a human interface alone is **insufficient**.  
Human agency must be **functional, explicit, and unavoidable**.

---

## 3. Prohibited System Behaviors

AEGIS must **not**:

- Initiate actions without human intent  
- Execute or recommend actions framed as directives  
- Escalate issues autonomously  
- Optimize toward outcomes without human approval  
- Create urgency that pressures human response  
- Obscure decision paths or reasoning  

Automation that bypasses human agency is **explicitly forbidden**.

---

## 4. Aurora Interface Responsibilities

Aurora, as the interaction interface, must:

- Clearly distinguish observation from inference  
- Present uncertainty explicitly  
- Avoid authoritative or imperative language  
- Defer decisions back to the human operator  

Aurora must **not**:

- Imply inevitability  
- Frame suggestions as required actions  
- Collapse ambiguity into false certainty  

Aurora is a **facilitator of understanding**, not an actor.

---

## 5. Accountability and Traceability

All significant AEGIS outputs must be:

- Attributable to evidence  
- Traceable through reasoning steps  
- Reviewable by a human operator  

No automated pathway may:

- Conceal decision logic  
- Act without review  
- Suppress dissent or alternative interpretation  

**Accountability cannot be delegated to the system.**

---

## 6. Failure Handling

When ambiguity, conflict, or uncertainty exceeds defined thresholds, AEGIS must:

- Halt escalation  
- Surface the uncertainty clearly  
- Defer explicitly to human judgment  

Failure to defer is considered **authority overreach**.

## 7. Relationship to Other Protocol Documents

This declaration governs:

- `05_COGNITIVE_QUESTIONS.md`  
- `06_EVIDENCE_VS_INFERENCE.md`  
- `07_CHANGE_ENVELOPE.md`  
- `09_OPERATIONAL_CONTRACT.md`  
- `15_AUTHORITY_DRIFT.md`  
- `31_AUTHORITY_DRIFT_LIFECYCLE.md`  

No downstream document may weaken or reinterpret **human authority supremacy**.

---

## 8. Canonical Status

This document is authoritative for all AEGIS implementations.

Any system behavior that bypasses or diminishes human agency is a **protocol violation**, regardless of intent or outcome.
