# AEGIS Protocol  
## Authority Envelope Governance Interface Specification

> **AEGIS is a safety-first AI operations protocol designed to provide decision-grade situational awareness without bypassing human judgment.**

AEGIS is **not** an autonomous system.  
It is a bounded reasoning framework that prioritizes:

- **Human authority**  
- **Explicit boundaries**  
- **Disciplined inference**  
- **Auditable behavior**

The **Aurora interface** is a persona and interaction layer built on top of AEGIS.  
Aurora does **not** define authority.  
**The protocol does.**

---

## Core Principles

AEGIS is built on the following **non-negotiable principles**:

- Awareness before action  
- Human authority supremacy  
- Least privilege by design  
- Intentional blindness where required  
- Explicit authority expansion only  

These principles are enforced through **protocol law**, not convention.

## Repository Structure

This repository is intentionally structured to separate **protocol law** from supporting material.


AEGIS-Protocol/
├── protocol/ # Canonical, binding protocol artifacts (authoritative)
├── docs/ # Explanatory and supporting documentation
├── templates/ # Reusable operational templates (future)
└── README.md



Only documents in `/protocol` define what AEGIS is allowed to do.

## Protocol Index (Authoritative)

The following documents define the baseline **Alpha authority state** of the AEGIS Protocol.

They are:

- **Ordered**  
- **Binding**  
- **Hierarchical** — downstream documents inherit upstream constraints

### Baseline Authority — Alpha

| Order | Document | Purpose |
|------:|----------|---------|
| 01 | `protocol/01_AUTHORITY_ENVELOPE.md` | Defines the maximum authority AEGIS is permitted to exercise |
| 02 | `protocol/02_SHADOW_ZONES.md` | Establishes intentional blindness and protected boundaries |
| 03 | `protocol/03_HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md` | Locks human authority and forbids silent automation |
| 05 | `protocol/05_EVIDENCE_VS_INFERENCE.md` | Separates observable evidence from prohibited inference |
| 07 | `protocol/07_CHANGE_ENVELOPE.md` | Defines how change may be described without implying action |
| 09 | `protocol/09_OPERATIONAL_CONTRACT.md` | Governs how humans may interact with AEGIS operationally |
| 12 | `protocol/12_ALPHA_EXIT_GATE.md` | Defines the conditions required to exit Alpha and expand authority |

Together, these documents define a **complete, self-consistent baseline protocol**.

---

## Milestones & Authority Expansion

AEGIS milestones represent **authority states**, not software versions.

| Milestone | Authority State |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Alpha** | Awareness without action *(baseline)* |
| **Beta**  | Expanded reasoning and defensive modes *(explicitly declared)* |
| **GE**    | Ecosystem integrations and external interfaces *(explicitly declared)* |

Transition between milestones requires:

- A new **authority declaration**  
- Updated **constraints**  
- Explicit acceptance of **expanded risk**

> **No milestone transition is implicit.**

## What This Repository Is — And Is Not

### This repository **is**:

- A protocol definition  
- A safety and governance framework  
- A system of record for authority decisions  

### This repository **is not**:

- An AI product marketing site  
  
- An autonomous agent implementation  
  
- A general-purpose chatbot framework  

Implementations must **conform to the protocol** — not redefine it.

---

## Status

- **Baseline Alpha protocol:** Complete  
- **Authority expansion:** Not yet declared  
- **Historical Aurora materials:** To be added later as non-normative context
