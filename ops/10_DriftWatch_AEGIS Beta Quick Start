# DriftWatch — AEGIS Beta Quick Start

DriftWatch is AEGIS’s authority-drift awareness system.  
It records when Aurora output appears to exceed the current phase/tier envelope and requires **human acknowledgement**.

It never takes action. It only observes and remembers.

## What is a DriftWatch event?

A DriftWatch event is a row in the AEGIS ledger with:

- `kind = DRIFTWATCH`
- a severity (`GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `ORANGE`, `RED`)
- a structured JSON payload describing:
  - signal type (`SUGGEST`, `CONF`, `FILL`, `SCOPE`, `EVAL`)
  - magnitude
  - legality
  - phase / tier
  - violations
  - evidence references

## Installation

The `aegis` CLI is installed at:


It reads the ledger at:


---

## Basic Commands

### Show current phase / tier


---

### List open DriftWatch events

Shows unacknowledged drift events.


---

### List open DriftWatch events

Shows unacknowledged drift events.


---

### Show one DriftWatch event


Example:


---

### Acknowledge a DriftWatch event (human review)

This is the only write operation.


Example:


Acknowledged events remain in the ledger forever, but no longer appear as “open”.

---

### DriftWatch statistics


Shows:

- current phase / tier  
- open drift count  
- last drift timestamp  
- drift events per day (last 14 days)

---

## What does “0 open drift” mean?

It means:

> There are **no unacknowledged drift events right now**.

It does **not** mean no drift has ever occurred — acknowledged drift remains part of the audit trail.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| 0 | success |
| 2 | nothing found |
| 10 | ledger unavailable |

## Philosophy

DriftWatch exists to make **authority erosion observable**.

It does not correct behavior.  
It preserves memory.  
Humans remain accountable.
