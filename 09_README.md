# AEGIS Protocol  
**Authority Envelope Governance Interface Specification**

> Forging resilient systems under real-world heat.

AEGIS is a governance framework for building AI-assisted systems that elevate human judgment instead of replacing it.

It defines how intelligent systems are allowed to observe, reason, and act — enforcing bounded authority, human-in-the-loop control, explainability, and auditability from the start.

This repository is the canonical specification for AEGIS.

## What AEGIS Is

AEGIS provides:

- Explicit authority boundaries for every system action  
- Evidence-first reasoning (no hidden inference chains)  
- Human escalation paths by design  
- Guardrails against authority drift  
- Post-incident accountability and reconstruction  

---

## What AEGIS Is Not

AEGIS is not:

- A chatbot  
- A monitoring tool  
- An automation engine  
- A replacement for engineers  

It is the framework that governs all of the above.
