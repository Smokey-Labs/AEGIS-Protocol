# Public Manifest

AEGIS is a **governance framework**, not a bot.

Aurora is an **interface**, not the project.

- No autonomous action without **explicit authority envelopes**.  
- No credentials, no runtime artifacts, no evidence blobs in this repository.  
- **Read-only by default** is non-negotiable.  
- Unknown domains are treated as **risk**, not opportunity.  
- Human escalation paths are a **feature**, not a failure.  

This repository exists to **preserve**
